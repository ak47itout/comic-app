# DASHTOON ASSIGNMENT
### **Objective:**

Developed a simple web application based on REACT Js that allows users to create and share a 10-panel comic strip. The comic is generated by inputting text into a form, which is then sent to a text-to-image API using a provided API key. This API is provided by DASHTOON!

It uses React version **18.2** and Tailwind CSS version **3.2**.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/thepranaygupta/react-tailwind-css-starter-pack.git
    ```

2. Install the required packages.
    ```sh
    cd react-tailwind-css-starter-pack
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the development server.
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
The project is set up to use `postcss-cli` to process your CSS files. You can add your own `tailwind.config.js` file to customize your Tailwind setup.
